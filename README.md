# Student-Website-Resource-Finder

During the winter term, I am building a student resource finder with html, javascript, and css to help prospective and enrolled students navigate the Oberlin Main Website. I have dubbed it Yeobie Says. I am presenting a prototype of what I have learned gathering information about the coding languages I used. It answers specific keywords, but outside of winter term, I plan to make it like chatGPT and then narrow it to Oberlin Specific Questions by using an api to pull responses from chatGPT 3.5 turbo.
